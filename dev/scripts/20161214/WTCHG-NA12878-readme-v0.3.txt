Terms of Use
============

The Data means the NA12878 sequence and associated data which is being
made available by the WTCHG and Genomics plc and for which principal
investigators who register and agree to these terms will be sent
credentials for download.

The Data are being released, in the spirit of the Fort Lauderdale
Agreement, by the University of Oxford's Wellcome Trust Centre
for Human Genetics (WTCHG) for the benefit of the wider scientific
community, subject to the following terms of use:

1. Registration: Applicants must be a Principal Investigator, Head of
Research Group, or a lead/managing scientist of equivalent status. All
applicants must complete the registration information before they can
download the Data.

2. Internal Use: The Data, and the Data download credentials supplied
by the WTCHG, must not be shared outside an applicant's
research group.

3. Publication Embargo: Applicants and members of their research group
may not publish in any scientific journal or pre-print archive any
results from their analysis of the Data until the WTCHG and Genomics
plc have published their own paper covering the generation and
analysis of the Data (Flagship Paper). The Flagship Paper is expected
to be submitted in the second quarter of 2017.

4. Pre-Embargo Acknowledgement: Prior to the lifting of the above
embargo, applicants and members of their research group may freely
present and discuss their own work using the Data, provided that they
include the following acknowledgement on any talks, posters, or other
written presentations:

"The NA12878 sequence data used in this research was generated
by the University of Oxford's Wellcome Trust Centre for Human
Genetics and Genomics plc using Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION
technology."

5. Post-Embargo Acknowledgement: Following the lifting of the above
embargo, applicants and members of their research group must cite the
Flagship Paper when publishing their analysis of the Data in any
scientific journal or pre-print archive, or when including the same in
any written presentations.

There are no further limitations on use of the Data.

Applicants should direct any questions regarding use of the Data to Dr
Rory Bowden at the WTCHG (rbowden@well.ox.ac.uk).

Available Files
===============

WTCHG-Gplc-NA12878-minion-R9.4-v0.3.tar

    Contains the following files:
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-pass-v0.3.bam
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-pass-v0.3.bam.bai
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-fail-v0.3.bam
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-fail-v0.3.bam.bai
    README_v0.3.txt

    Reads were mapped to hs37d5lam.fasta including lambda phage
    control sequences using "bwa mem" with the following options:
    "-x ont2d -t 12 -R "@RG\tID:1\tSM:NA12878" -M". Reads were
    mapped per flow-cell and then merged using "samtools merge"
    to produce the final output, comprising bam and bam index (.bai) 
    files. PASS and FAIL reads are provided in separate files.


WTCHG-Gplc-NA12878-minion-R9.4-v0.3-chr22.tar

    Contains the following files:
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-pass-v0.3-chr22.bam
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-pass-v0.3-chr22.bam.bai
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-fail-v0.3-chr22.bam
    NA12878-minion-R9.4-fail-v0.3-chr22.bam.bai
    README_v0.3.txt

    Reads were mapped to hs37d5lam.fasta including lambda phage
    control sequences using "bwa mem" with the following options:
    "-x ont2d -t 12 -R "@RG\tID:1\tSM:NA12878" -M". Reads were
    mapped per flow-cell and then merged using "samtools merge"
    to produce the final output, comprising bam and bam index (.bai) 
    files. PASS and FAIL reads for chromosome 22 only are provided 
    in separate files.


hs37d5lam.fasta.tgz

    The reference sequence in fasta format that reads were mapped
    to. The reference sequence consists of the 1000 Genomes reference
    (see Notes below) to which the sequence of the lambda phage used
    as spike-in was added.


Notes
=====

We will release the reads (.fast5) from the MinION runs used to 
generate this base-called data. 

The 1000 Genomes reference sequence is available at 
http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/-
phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/hs37d5.fa.gz

In our analyses we declare PASS reads to be at least 1 kbase in length
and have and average quality of 14 or more.

Tool versions
=============

Nanonet:  v2.0.0   (Installed on 15.11.2016)
bwa: 	  0.7.12

Data generation
===============

DNA was prepared according to the Damaged library improvement protocol
(https://community.nanoporetech.com/protocols/damaged-library-improvement/v/dle_9023_v7_revd_23aug2016)
with size selection using BluePippin 0.75% DF Marker S1 high-pass
6-10kb v3 protocol with BPstart of 6kb.

Libraries were generated with the SQK-LSK108 Ligation Sequencing Kit
1D (R9.4) and sequenced using SpotON R9.4 flowcells on a MinION Mk 1B.
