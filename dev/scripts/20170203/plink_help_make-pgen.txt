--make-pgen <vzs> <format=[code]> <pvar-cols=[column set descriptor]>
            <psam-cols=[column set descriptor]>
--make-bpgen <vzs> <format=[code]>
--make-bed <vzs>
  Create a new binary fileset (--make-pgen = .pgen + .pvar{.gz} + .psam,
  --make-bpgen = .pgen + .bim{.gz} + .fam).
  * Unlike the automatic text-to-binary converters (which only heed
    chromosome filters), this supports all of plink2's filtering flags.
  * The 'vzs' modifier causes the variant file (.pvar/.bim) to be
    Zstd-compressed (not implemented yet).
  * The 'format' modifier requests an uncompressed fixed-variant-width .pgen
    file.  (These do not directly support multiallelic variants.)  The
    following format code is currently supported:
      2: just like .bed, except with an extended (12-byte instead of 3-byte)
         header containing variant/sample counts, and rotated genotype codes
         (00 = hom ref, 01 = het, 10 = hom alt, 11 = missing).
  * The first five columns of a .pvar file are always #CHROM/POS/ID/REF/ALT.
    Supported optional .pvar column sets are:
      xheader: All ## header lines (yeah, this is technically not a column).
               Without this, only the #CHROM header line is kept.
      maybequal: QUAL.  Omitted if all loaded values are missing.
      qual: Force QUAL column to be written even when empty.
      maybefilter: FILTER.  Omitted if all loaded values are missing.
      filter: Force FILTER column to be written even when empty.
      maybeinfo: INFO.  Omitted if all loaded values are missing, or if
                 INFO:PR is the only subfield.
      info: Force INFO column to be written.
      maybecm: Centimorgan coordinate.  Omitted if all loaded values are 0.
      cm: Force CM column to be written even when empty.
    The default is xheader,maybequal,maybefilter,maybeinfo,maybecm.
  * The first two columns of a .psam file are always #FID/IID.  Supported
    optional .psam column sets are:
      maybesid: Sample disambiguation ID (useful when multiple samples are
                collected from a single organism), '0' = missing.  Omitted if
                all loaded values are missing.
      sid: Force SID column to be written even when empty.
      maybeparents: Father and mother IIDs, '0' = missing.  Omitted if all
                    loaded values are missing.
      parents: Force PAT and MAT columns to be written even when empty.
      sex: '1'/'M'/'m' = male, '2'/'F'/'f' = female, 'NA'/'0' = missing.
      pheno1: First active phenotype.  If none, all column entries are set to
              the --output-missing-phenotype string.
      phenos: All active phenotypes, if any.  (Can be combined with pheno1 to
              force at least one phenotype column to be written.)
    The default is maybesid,maybeparents,sex,phenos.
